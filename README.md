## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating robust sentiment analysis models across multiple languages and diverse datasets. The study incorporates data from various sources including Twitter, social media platforms, and review websites, with special attention to handling multilingual text, emojis, and informal language patterns.

## Key Objectives
- Develop sentiment analysis models that can effectively process and analyze text in multiple languages
- Handle complex text features including code-mixed data and emoji usage
- Implement and compare different approaches for multilingual text representation
- Evaluate model performance across diverse datasets and languages

## Technical Approach
The project will involve:
- Comprehensive data preprocessing to handle:
  - Tokenization challenges
  - Special characters
  - Emoji processing
  - Informal text patterns
- Implementation of various text representation techniques
- Model training and evaluation across multiple languages
- Performance analysis using multiple metrics
